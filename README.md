# DicFix

DicFix is a lightweight macOS utility that provides a seamless dictation window for any application, making it perfect for terminals like Alacritty or any other app that lacks native dictation support.

The motivation for this project was to use voice dictation with modern CLI tools, such as AI assistants (Claude, Gemini), where speaking a command or prompt can be more efficient than typing. DicFix bridges this gap by providing a simple, customizable pop-up that captures your speech and sends it to your desired target.

## Features

-   **Global Dictation**: Use dictation in any application, whether it supports it or not.
-   **Multiple Targets**: Send text to the clipboard, paste it directly, type it out as keystrokes, or print it to standard output.
-   **Seamless Workflow**: The app automatically closes and sends the text when it loses focus or when you press `Enter`.
-   **Highly Customizable**: Configure the window's appearance, position, fonts, colors, and default target via a simple JSON file.
-   **Command-Line Control**: Override settings and send text directly from the command line for scripting and automation.

## Workflow

1.  **Launch**: Trigger DicFix using a hotkey or by running the app.
2.  **Dictate**: The pop-up window appears. Start speaking.
3.  **Confirm**: When you are finished, either press `Enter` or simply click away to make the window lose focus.
4.  **Output**: The app automatically closes, and the transcribed text is sent to your configured target (e.g., clipboard, active application).

## Configuration

DicFix is configured by editing `settings.json`. By default, this file is located at:

`~/Library/Application Support/dicfix/settings.json`

The app will create this file with default values on its first run.

### Custom Configuration Path

You can tell DicFix to use a different location for its configuration directory by using the `defaults` command. This is useful if you prefer to keep all your configuration files in a single place, like `~/.config`.

Run the following command in your terminal, replacing the path with your desired location:

```bash
defaults write io.leejones.dicfix ConfigPath "~/.config/dicfix"
```

The next time you launch DicFix, it will create and read its `settings.json` and `history.txt` from that new directory.

### Example `settings.json`

```json
{
  "windowY": 957,
  "promptBody": "gemini",
  "fontSize": 20,
  "promptPrefix": "â€º",
  "windowX": 1217,
  "opacity": 0.2,
  "promptPrefixColor": "systemBlue",
  "promptSuffixColor": "#BF616B",
  "windowHeight": 50,
  "fontName": "DaddyTimeMono Nerd Font",
  "promptBodyColor": "labelColor",
  "textColor": "secondaryLabelColor",
  "promptSuffix": "$ ",
  "windowWidth": 600,
  "target": "paste"
}
```

### Options

-   **`target`**: The default output destination for the text.
    -   `"clipboard"` or `"pasteboard"`: Copies the text to the system clipboard.
    -   `"paste"`: Copies the text and then simulates a `Cmd+V` keystroke to paste it.
    -   `"keystroke"`: Simulates typing the text character by character. (Requires Accessibility permissions).
    -   `"stdout"`: Prints the text to standard output. This is useful for scripting.
-   **Window & Appearance**:
    -   `windowX`, `windowY`: The screen coordinates for the window's top-left corner.
    -   `windowWidth`, `windowHeight`: The dimensions of the window.
    -   `opacity`: The background opacity, from `0.0` (fully transparent) to `1.0` (fully opaque).
-   **Font**:
    -   `fontName`: The name of the font to use.
    -   `fontSize`: The size of the font.
-   **Prompt**:
    -   `promptPrefix`, `promptBody`, `promptSuffix`: The text for each of the three parts of the prompt.
-   **Colors**:
    -   `promptPrefixColor`, `promptBodyColor`, `promptSuffixColor`: The color for each part of the prompt.
    -   `textColor`: The color of the dictated text in the text field.
    -   `placeholder`: The placeholder text to display in the input field when it is empty.
    -   `placeholderColor`: The color of the placeholder text.
    -   **Color Formats**: Colors can be specified using several formats:
        -   **Hex RGB**: `"#BF616B"`
        -   **Named Web Colors**: `"red"`, `"cyan"`, `"magenta"` (lowercase)
        -   **macOS System Colors**: `"systemBlue"`, `"labelColor"`, `"windowBackgroundColor"` (camelCase, matching the system names)

## Command-Line Usage

You can also run DicFix from the command line and override its behavior with arguments.

```bash
# Run with a specific target
dicfix --target stdout

# Send text directly without opening the UI
dicfix --target paste --text "Hello, World!"

# Override the prompt displayed in the UI
dicfix --prompt "Speak now:"
```

### Arguments

-   `--target <target>`: Overrides the `target` from `settings.json`. Valid targets are `clipboard`, `paste`, `keystroke`, and `stdout`.
-   `--text <string>`: Immediately sends the provided string to the specified target without showing the dictation window.
-   `--prompt <string>`: Overrides the `promptBody` setting for the current run.
-   `--placeholder <string>`: Overrides the `placeholder` text for the current run.
-   `--placeholder-color <color>`: Overrides the `placeholderColor` for the current run.

## Integration with Alacritty

You can launch DicFix from Alacritty using a keybinding. Add the following to your `alacritty.toml` file (usually located at `~/.config/alacritty/alacritty.toml`).

This example binds `Shift+Command+d` to launch the app:

```toml
[keyboard]
bindings = [
  # Add this binding to launch DicFix
  { key = "d", mods = "Shift|Command", command = { program = "open", args = ["-a", "dicfix"] } }
]
```

**Note**: You may need to choose a different keybinding if your preferred combination is already reserved by macOS for a system-wide shortcut (like the default Dictation shortcut).

## Building from Source

This project uses [Tuist](https://tuist.io) to manage the Xcode project generation.

1.  **Install Tuist**: If you don't have Tuist, you can install it easily.
    ```bash
    curl -Ls https://tuist.io/install.sh | bash
    ```

2.  **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/thisleejones/dicfix.git
    cd dicfix
    ```

3.  **Generate the Xcode Project**:
    ```bash
    tuist generate
    ```

4.  **Open and Build**:
    -   Open the newly created `dicfix.xcworkspace` file.
    -   Build the project in Xcode (`Cmd+B`).
    -   The compiled `dicfix.app` will be in the `build/Build/Products/Debug/` directory. You can move this to your `/Applications` folder for easy access.
